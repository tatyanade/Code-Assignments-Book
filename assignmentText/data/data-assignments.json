From infancy we easily recognize faces, and can detect very subtle shifts in facial expressions, often being able to discern the slightest change in mood and sincerity in ways that remain impossible for computers. From faces we also are readily able to identify family resemblances, or \"strangers\" in crowds, and we are transfixed by the ways in which the lines on a face can reveal a person's life history. Kyle McDonald writes that \"faces are so important that the impairment of our face-processing ability is seen as a disorder, called *prosopagnosia*, while unconsciously seeing faces where there are none is an almost universal kind of *pareidolia*.\"\n\nThis assignment draws inspiration from the “Chernoff Face\" data visualization technique, which leverages this sensitivity by using facial features to represent multivariate data. In Chernoff Faces, features such as eyes, ears, mouth and nose represent data according to their shape, size, placement and orientation. Whereas Chernoff (1973) used 18 variables to *synthesize* a face, Paul Ekman’s \"Facial Action Coding System\" uses 46 dimensions to *analyze* a facial expression, each corresponding to the action of a different facial muscle.",

Our current conception of time with days are divided into 24 hours, hours into 60 minutes and minutes into 60 seconds, is also a relic of ancient history and comes from the Greek's who devised this scale during the centuries following 200BC. More recently in the 19th century, the introduction of railway networks marked the beginning a still unfolding relationship between technological networks and our collective understanding of time. Both mass transport networks and computer networks alike, demand the synchronisation of time across geographical distance and drive an ongoing attempt to standardise time.\n\nYet despite the widespread adoption of a univeral machinic standard, there are many other ways to understand time. Psychological time contracts and expands, time from the perspective of non-human systems time oscillates and cycles rather than proceeds linearly, and in the case of geological or planetary time rythms can span millenia. During the early twentieth century, Einstein's revelations in theoretical physics also reformed our understanding of time, proposing that it is not a constant linear stream but is relative to the position from where it is measured. \n\nThis assignment provides an opportunity to engage with the rich history of the technological mediation of time and the arbitrary nature of its divisions in hours, minute and seconds.

Populate your landscape with features that are suitable for your concept: perhaps trees, buildings, vehicles, animals, people, food items, body parts, hairs, zombies etc.\n\nThe landscape should move past the 'camera', but you can elect the manner by which it does so; for example, it might appear to scroll by (as if you were looking out the window of a train); or approach from a first-person point of view (as if you were driving), or slide underneath (as if you were looking out of a glass-bottomed airplane). The camera might be viewing an outside environment, or viewing objects on a conveyor belt, etc. If you are an advanced student, you may wish to experiment with the camera() command, which allows for the specification of moving cameras.\n\nGive consideration to the depth of variation in your landscape: after how much time does your landscape become predictable? How might you extend this inevitability as much as possible? How can you make a landscape which is both consistent yet surprising? You may need to make a variety of different elements, and continually change how you clump them. Or perhaps these elements themselves are generative, and synthesized on-the-fly.

        "makingitmeaningful": "Randomness and unpredicability in both art and computation have a long and controversial history. Duchamp's early chance procedures resulted in works like Erratum musical (1913) and are exmples of early visual musial experiements exploring random or unpredicatable elements in their conception. The work of many Dada artists continued Duchamp's trajectories with Hans Arp producing compositions for paintings and drawing derived from falling paper and XX producing methods for writing poetry by cutting newspaper articles into words and then drawing them from a hat to create new verse. The Situationalists were also known for their random walks and other unpredicable way finding works. Decades later, works like 4:33 by John Cage are also celebrated for their insertion of chance and complexity into creative process. \nRandomness and unpredicability has also been a significant challenge in the evolution of computation and are useful for simulation, decision making and achieveing particular aesthetic outcomes. How to acheive a set of numbers where one is completely independent of the next, remains difficult to acheive in a precise procedural machine and throughout the hisotry of computatino many strategies have been used to do this. Look up tables of numbers where no information is passed on from one to the next were commonly used and in 1955 Rand published a book of 1 million random digits (that can be downloaded here). Jon Von Neuman developed the idea of pseudo randomness by calculating a series by taking the square of a number, and then selecting the middle 3 digits as the next number and then repeating. However, when run long enough, even this approach often leads to loops of similar values. The current Linux system uses key strokes, i/o data and voltage across certain parts as always varying inputs to its pseudorandom generator. Similarly, other systems use environmental variables. \nPerlin noise is another example of producing unpredicability in calculated systems. It was developed by Ken Perlin in 1998 during his work on the film Tron and for which he was later awarded an Academy Award. Perlin noise produces unpredicable values within a certain scope influenced by the previous value. Perlin released this work in the public domain and It has been signifcant to computer generated imagery ever since, enabling a more convincing rendering of things like flames, clouds and smoke. \n\nMore on randomness here: \nhttp://cmuems.com/2012/a/lectures/lecture-05/\nhttps://www.courses.tegabrain.com/PVA1/?page_id=617 ",
