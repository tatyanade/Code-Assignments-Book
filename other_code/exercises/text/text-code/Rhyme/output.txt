A cone costs five cents on Mondays.
The dry wax protects the deep Mondays.

The nag pulled the frail cart along.
Farmers came in to thresh the oat truong.

The bombs left most of the town in ruins.
The birch looked stark white and ruins.

A flat pack takes less luggage space.
Wipe the grease off his dirty face.

The little tales they tell are false.
Send the stuff in a thick paper waltz.

The tin box held priceless stones.
The stray cat gave birth to intones.

Press the pedal with your left foot.
Two blue fish swam in the pussyfoot.

Light maple makes for a swell room.
The weight of the package was seen on the high fume.

Pure bred poodles have curls.
The pirates seized the crew of the lost twirls.

Bottles hold four kinds of rum.
Look in the corner to find the tan alum.
