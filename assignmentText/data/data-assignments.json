        "brief": "Create a \"bot\" that posts to an online social media platform. Your bot might explore a particular issue, publish generated content, perform a character, communicate an emotional disposition, interact with users, draw on content from a source text, or promote a specific agenda. It may be a publishing platform, intermittently publishing content to an audience of online subscribers, or it may be programmed to be a social actor, interacting with other users online. Explore the different possible interactions afforded by the API of your chosen platform.\n \n\n\n",
        "variations": "•  Beginners can start by using an online notification service such as *If This Then That* (IFTTT) to automate online interactions with minimal coding.\n•  Create a bot that responds to an online datastream or archive such as that of the New York Times. This will likely require you to navigate another API in addition to that of the social media platform where you are publishing their content. \n•  Tailor your bot so that it reveals something interesting about the API of the online platform you are using. ",
        "makingitmeaningful": "A bot is a software agent that acts autonomously and their promise and peril have inspired numerous fictionsal characters like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Natural language researchers developed early chatbots like Eliza which was the first program to pass the Turing test. Machine learning and natural language processing continue to be developed with the aim of making bot assistents, translators or potentially even companions that can learn as they interact with users. \n \nBots are so widely used online that researchers estimate over half of all traffic is generated by non-human agents. Search engine bots to crawl the web indexing content and botnets compromise online services through DDoS attacks. Social media bots publish artistic, literary and scientific content to online audiences with bot maker Allison Parrish offering a model for defining poetic or artistic bots called “PUDG” - procedural, uncreative, data-driven graffetti (Parrish, 2016). Bots like @aLonelyProject socialize with human users or can be designed to act with political agendas, see the @congressedits Twitter bot that tweets Wikipedia edits made from IP addresses located in congress or James Briddel’s @dronestagram bot that posts satellite images of drone strike locations. \n",
