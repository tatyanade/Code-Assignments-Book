      "brief": "Your job, Dr. Frankenstein, is to create new life. Program a sensate creature, a dynamic flock or swarm, an artificial cell-culture, a novel plant or an ecosystem. Your response should algorithmically generate the form and behavior of your new lifeforms. Will they be able to sleep, reproduce, die or eat one another? Consider the relationships between the individuals in your species and develop a corrosponding interplay of simulated forces such as attraction, repulsion or indifference . Your ecosystem may also have abiotic elements or several local environments that exerts differeing drag forces. \nGive consideration to the potential for your software to operate as a cultural artifact. Can it attain special relevance by addressing a real human need or interest?",
      "variations": "•  Create an ecosystem containing a pair of creatures or a 'dyad'. \n•  Write a class for a creature and exchange your class with other students. Collect at least two other classes of species and implement them to create an ecosyste that is home to your collected creatures. This variation could be implemented using a versioning tool such as Github where students are asked to fork each others repositories and implement the code. In this way students gain insight into the importance of commenting code and communicating their work.",
