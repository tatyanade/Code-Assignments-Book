Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.
Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated.
Thank you very much.
I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
She congratulated us — it’s about us — on our victory,
and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.
I mean, she — she fought very hard.
Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time,
and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
I mean that very sincerely.
Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together.
To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation,
I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
